# FirstTimeEver
First time ever doing anything related to coding at all. First hobby step, skrtttt.
I'm a college student who's looking for something to do on the side thats challenging, but also can be anything I want it to be. This seemed like the perfect fit. Love playing basketball and video games, smoking weed, and whatever makes me happy.
